Welcome to my GitHub.

I am a self-hosting enthusiast who is particularly interested in server management, networking, and system optimization. My work focuses on:

Designing and administering efficient, privacy-focused systems.
Investigating novel solutions for server and network configuration. 
Continuously acquiring and using practical technical skills.

Key areas of interest.

Server management entails designing and maintaining systems that favor dependability and control.
Networking: Streamlining networks to improve performance and security.
Self-hosting: Using private, self-sufficient solutions to reduce reliance on third-party services.

What To Expect

You'll find personal projects, tools, and resources that reflect my experience with server management and system architecture. I want to share my work and learn from the larger IT community.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub. Let's work together and invent!
